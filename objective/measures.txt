STOI compares Speech intelligibility and does not really apply to Drum Records:
STOI Score	Interpretation
~1.0		Excellent intelligibility
0.8 – 1.0	Good intelligibility
0.6 – 0.8	Fair intelligibility
< 0.6		Poor intelligibility
STOI of original recording (degraded), and the filtered recording (reference): the original recording has slightly lower STOI compared to filtered recording
0.9956
STOI of filtered recodring (degraded), and the original recording (reference): the filtered recording has slightly higher STOI compared to original recording
0.9960

PESQ measures clarity of a audio channel. 
Higher PESQ scores indicate better (speech) quality.
It models human auditory perception, capturing effects like distortion, background noise, clipping, and delay.
Widely used in telecom, VoIP, and audio processing to measure speech enhancement or degradation.
Higher PESQ = better perceived audio quality
PESQ ≈ 4.5 means near-perfect clarity.
PESQ < 2.0 means very poor or unintelligible speech.
PESQ Score	MOS Value	Quality Category
4.0 - 4.5	4 - 5		Excellent (No noticeable defects)
3.0 - 3.99	3		Fair
2.0 - 2.99	2		Poor
  < 2.0		1		Bad
PESQ of original recording (degraded), and the filtered recording (reference): the original recording has fair quality compared to the filtered recording
3.6052
PESQ of filtered recodring (degraded), and the original recording (reference): the filtered recording has excellent quality compared to original recording
